\section{Executive Summary}
Today's society is increasingly more computer-oriented. The cost of deploying web- and gaming applications has significantly shrunk, but it is still costly for individual enthusiasts to host their own internet applications. In particular, students and young computer game fanatics suffer from relatively high costs of managing their personal servers. Wyvern aims to address these issues. Wyvern is a unique community aiming to provide users with the means to host their own web applications on a single shared bare-metal machine. With this approach, the effective monthly cost may be as low as three euros, whilst each user still maintains a significant proportion of the available resources. This document describes the Wyvern community, its administration team, its financial aspects, and its regulations.
