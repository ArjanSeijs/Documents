\section{Introduction}
Wyvern is the idea to collaboratively rent a single bare metal server. The intent is to support several gaming servers for community use, as well as provide options to host small personal web applications. By spreading financial load, the cost per person is reduced, expected to be as low as three euros. Wyvern users may access the server through an SSH connection, as well as SFTP to manage files and applications. In addition, subgroups of users may host more computationally expensive applications as system resources are shared.

This rest of this document describes the specifics of the Wyvern project, such as financial and administrative responsibilities, server policies and democratic decisioning. These are first introduced in sections \ref{sec:administration}, \ref{sec:policy}, and \ref{sec:technical}. A complete description of the decision-making process, responsibilities of the administration team, and the voting process is presented in appendix \ref{sec:bureaucracy}. Lastly, a guide on how to setup SSH to connect through key-based authentication is provided in \ref{sec:ssh}.
