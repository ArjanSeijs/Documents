\section{Financial}
\label{sec:financial}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wyvern obtains funds through member contribution and any other lawful means.

    \item The Chief of Finance manages the funds. They may be stored in cash or electronically on a personal bank account managed by the Chief of Finance.

    \item All Wyvern members have financial responsibility. Financial responsibility includes the obligation to pay contribution or incurred damages (or fraction thereof) within the timespan and with the conditions to be decided upon by the administration team.

    \begin{item}
        All members must pay contribution.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The contribution fee is equal to the server upkeep costs for one term divided by the number of Wyvern members.
            \item The contribution fee is calculated at the beginning of a term and is fixed for the duration of that term.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{item}

    \item \label{itm:funds} Unless otherwise decided in a vote, Wyvern funds are fully expended for the upkeep of the server at the next term.

    \item With exception of article \ref{sec:financial}.\ref{itm:funds}, Wyvern funds may only be expended with approval of the Wyvern community through a vote.

    \begin{item}
         In case of unexpected costs resulting from the operation of the Wyvern server, services hosted by the Wyvern community, or by services hosted by members of the Wyvern community, the Director must host an exceptional community meeting to discuss this topic.
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item During such an exceptional meeting, the origin of the unexpected financial damage must be determined and the extent of the damage must be quantified.

            \begin{item}
                The meeting must decide by majority vote one of the following:

                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \label{itm:damage-negligence} The financial damage has as basis the negligence of a single Wyvern member or a group thereof.
                    \item \label{itm:damage-normal} The financial damage has as basis the normal operation of Wyvern services.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{item}

            \item In case that article \ref{sec:financial}.\ref{itm:damage-negligence} holds true, the financial responsibility is placed upon the responsible Wyvern member or group thereof.

            \item In case that article \ref{sec:financial}.\ref{itm:damage-normal} holds true, the shared financial responsibility is placed equally upon all Wyvern members.
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{item}
