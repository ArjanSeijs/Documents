\section{Introduction}
Wyvern is the idea to collaboratively rent a single bare metal server. The intent is to support several gaming servers for community use and to provide options for hosting small personal web applications. By spreading upkeep costs the monthly cost per person is reduced and is expected to be around three euros. Wyvern users may access the server through an SSH or SFTP connection to manage files and applications. In addition, subgroups of users may host more computationally expensive applications because system resources are shared.

The rest of this document describes the specifics of the Wyvern community, such as the financial and administrative responsibilities (section~\ref{sec:administration}), technical details (section~\ref{sec:technical}), server policies and democratic decisioning (section~\ref{sec:policy}), and LAN-parties (section~\ref{sec:lan}). A complete description of the decision-making process, responsibilities of the administration team, and the voting process is presented in appendix \ref{sec:bureaucracy}. Lastly, a guide on how to setup SSH to connect through key-based authentication is provided in \ref{sec:ssh}.
